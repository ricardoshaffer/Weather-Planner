# Weather-Planner

As a user, enter city(ies) to search the weather for 5 days, and get back the forecast and UV index.

## Functionality

- search for a city function utilizes event listeners for 'enter/return'.
- city is then stored locally and appended to a list as a value.
- weather API utilizes the city, as it is entered or the list item as it is clicked, to render weather.
- javascript compiles the weather, appends icon code, and presents the current & forecasted weather.
- Images utilize 'weather description' as alt tags to increase accessibility.

## File Structure

- Assets folder contains:
    - style.css: lightweight css for colors & fonts.
    - weather.js: contains API protocol, objects, and localStorage functions
    - index.html: contains headers, and renders the page.
